//  Why classes?
//  We usually define our models using structs, but we need reference types this time around. We're going to be passing objects around from one VC to the next and mutating certaint properties based on user input. With the copy behavior of value types, ethis can get messy. We'Re also going to need to maintain states across our models, and value types aren't good at that.
